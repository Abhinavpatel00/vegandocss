# Animal agriculture -  The culture of killing 


The animal agriculture industry is a major contributor to global warming and its environmental impacts have been widely studied and documented in scientific literature.

One of the most comprehensive studies on the subject was conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and published in a report called "Livestock's Long Shadow." The report found that the livestock sector is responsible for 14.5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, including 37% of methane emissions and 65% of nitrous oxide emissions. These emissions come from sources such as enteric fermentation in livestock, manure management, and rice cultivation.

Another study published in the journal Nature estimates that the livestock sector accounts for around 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and states that reducing the consumption of animal products is one of the most effective ways for individuals to reduce their carbon footprint.

Moreover, other research found that the global production of animal feed is responsible for a significant proportion of deforestation and that, for example, in the Amazon, about 80% of the land deforested since 1970 is used for pastures for cattle ranching.

In addition, industrial livestock production also requires a large amount of energy, water, and resources, including land, feed, and water. The transportation of animals and animal products also contributes to emissions, particularly from the fossil fuels used in the process.

It's worth noting that the majority of emissions in animal agriculture come from large-scale industrial farms and intensive livestock production, rather than from small-scale, sustainable, and regenerative farming methods.

One research paper on the subject, "Greenhouse gas emissions from the dairy sector: a global life cycle assessment" by J.C. Garnett et al. published in Climatic Change, provides a detailed study on the emissions from global dairy sector and it found that the dairy sector accounts for around 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 2.5% of global anthropogenic emissions.

In conclusion, the scientific literature clearly indicates that the animal agriculture industry is a significant contributor to global warming, and reducing consumption of animal products and supporting sustainable and regenerative farming methods can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change.
