# Vegetarianism and veganism, Are really the same? 

"I don't harm animals. Because I don't eat meat" this statement by people is common now a days. But is it really true? If someone is not eating meat does it means that he/she is not contributing to hurt animals? Let's see is it true or not. 

Welcome dear to one more new lesson of veganism. Not veganism but kind of discussion over interesting topic. 



At first glance, veganism and plant-based diets might seem like the same thing, but they are actually two distinct concepts.Like completely different with some similarities. 


A vegan diet is a type of plant-based diet that is void of any animal products, this means that it excludes meat, dairy, eggs, and any other animal-derived products. But veganism goes beyond diet, it's a lifestyle and ethical choice that seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practical, all forms of exploitation and cruelty to animals for food, clothing, or any other purpose. According to encyclopedia veganism is *the theory or practice of abstaining from the consumption and use of animal products. While some vegans avoid only animal-derived food, many others also exclude any items that use animals as ingredients or for testing*.

On the other hand, a plant-based diet is a diet that primarily consists of plants, this means that it mainly includes fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, and nuts, however, it does not necessarily exclude animal products. This means that some individuals may choose to eat a plant-based diet for health reasons, but continue to consume animal products, such as honey or eggs, which is not consistent with veganism.

Both veganism and plant-based diets can have significant positive impacts on our health, the environment, and the lives of animals. A plant-based diet can reduce the risk of chronic diseases, lower cholesterol and blood pressure and improve overall health. Veganism can do all of that, but in addition, it also reduces the exploitation of animals and is more environmentally friendly. if we dive deep into the thoughts that what veganism is then we'll get to know that veganism is not just a lifestyle or dietary practice but it's much more than that. 




It is important to note that, everyone has different reasons and motivations for choosing to follow a vegan or plant-based diet, and that is perfectly fine. Some people may choose one lifestyle over the other, while others may choose a combination of both. The most important thing is to make choices that align with your ethics and do your best to reduce harm and exploitation as much as you can.

We hope this page helped to clear up any confusion you might have had about the difference between veganism and plant-based diets and provided you with a deeper understanding and appreciation of these lifestyles. They both have their own unique sets of beliefs and priorities and can bring about significant positive change in the world.

Choosing a vegan or plant-based lifestyle can be an emotional journey. It can be difficult to reconcile the idea of harming or exploiting animals with our own values and beliefs. It can also be challenging to navigate a food system that is often built around animal products. But it is important to remember that every small step counts and it is not about perfection but progress.

At the end of the day, the choice between a vegan or plant-based lifestyle is a personal one, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's about finding a way to live that feels authentic to you, and that aligns with your values and beliefs. We encourage you to explore different options, do your own research and consult with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian if you have any questions or concerns. Remember, you are not alone in this journey, and by making a conscious choice, you are part of a larger community that is working towards a more compassionate and sustainable world
