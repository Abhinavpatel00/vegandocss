But hey , you new being in this journey , no need to worry .

The origins of veganism can be traced back to ancient Eastern cultures, where vegetarianism was practiced for both ethical and health reasons. However, the modern vegan movement as we know it began in the 1940s. The term "vegan" was coined by Donald Watson, a member of the British Vegetarian Society, in 1944. Watson and a group of like-minded individuals formed the Vegan Society, which was dedicated to promoting a lifestyle that excluded the use of animal products for any purpose.

One of the earliest and most influential figures in the vegan movement was a British philosopher and ethical theorist named Dr. Peter Singer. His 1975 book "Animal Liberation" is considered a classic in the animal rights movement and has been credited with inspiring many people to adopt a vegan lifestyle.

As the vegan movement gained momentum, more and more plant-based options became available, making it easier for people to follow a vegan diet. In recent years, veganism has experienced a resurgence in popularity, driven in part by concerns about health, environmental sustainability, and animal welfare. Many celebrities and public figures have also adopted a vegan lifestyle, further increasing the visibility and mainstream acceptance of veganism.

The vegan movement is also increasingly recognized as a social justice movement. It challenges societal norms, discrimination, and oppression of marginalized groups, it also intersects with other social justice issues such as racial and economic inequalities.

Today, the vegan movement is global and diverse, with a growing number of organizations, festivals, and events dedicated to promoting a vegan lifestyle. From vegan food festivals, to animal rights marches and more.
