These foods are rich in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber, and are also low in calories and saturated fat.

It's also important to pay attention to the specific nutrients that can be harder to get from a vegan diet. These include **protein, iron, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids, and Vitamin B12** . 

## Plant based sources of few most important nutrients 

* Protein - beans, lentils, and tofu, and fortified plant-based milks, and meat alternatives. 
* Iron - leafy green vegetables, whole grains, and fortified breakfast cereals. 
* Calcium - fortified plant-based milks, leafy green vegetables, and fortified orange juice. 
* Omega-3s - flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts. Vitamin B12 can be found in fortified foods, like plant-based milks and breakfast cereals, or supplements.

It's also important to keep in mind that a vegan diet is not a "one-size-fits-all" solution, and it is essential to work with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian to ensure that your vegan diet is meeting your specific nutritional needs.

But following a balanced vegan diet is not only about getting the right nutrients, it's also about embracing a new way of looking at food, and the world. It's an opportunity to become more conscious of what you're putting in your body, how it's produced, and how it affects the environment and animals. It's also a chance to discover new foods, flavors and ways of cooking, and to explore a whole new world of delicious, healthy, and ethical food options.

Another important thing to consider when following a vegan diet is to make sure that your diet is balanced and varied. This means including a wide range of different plant-based foods and nutrients to ensure that you're getting all the essential vitamins and minerals your body needs. It's also important to pay attention to portion sizes, and to make sure you're not overconsuming foods high in **saturated fat** or **added sugars**.

One great way to ensure you're getting a balanced vegan diet is to eat according to the plate method, which is about ` filling half your plate with non-starchy vegetables, a quarter with whole grains, and a quarter with a protein source`. You can also supplement your diet with fortified foods or supplements to make sure you are getting all the necessary nutrients`.
